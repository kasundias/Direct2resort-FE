            <h4>Our Story</h4>
            <p>
              IVYS International started its journey in Sri Lanka following the growing interest of the medicinal 
              and cosmetic benefits of essential oils derived from a host of herbal, spice and flowering plants 
              that are grown widely in Sri Lanka and it has been a long kept secret that found its way to the rest of the world.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a result, IVYS International, had been providing pure essential oils and value
              added products across local and a number of international markets through
              our own sources in Sri Lanka over a decade and trusted for our quality.
